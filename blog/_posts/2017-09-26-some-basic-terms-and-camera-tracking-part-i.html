<p>In the last post, I discussed what Animation is and some types of animation. At the end of the post, there was a video that used Camera tracking. In this post, I’ll be giving an overview of what was done to get that result.</p><p>The software that I used is Blender. It is a free open-source software developed by Blender Foundation. Before getting into the specifics of the post let’s have a look at the interface of the software and some basic terms of 3D animation.</p><figure data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-height="400" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/b33aec5a59bc87bb2684c9a7c8abe8cc/tumblr_inline_owunraWCgA1v99f5f_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-height="400"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1031" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ab788e5c8c2aa5264029523098259f3b/tumblr_inline_owun6gOuW51v99f5f_540.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1920" data-orig-height="1031"/></figure><p>This is the start-up screen.</p><p>1.      Camera</p><p>2.      Lamp/Light Source</p><p>3.      Timeline</p><p>4.      Render options</p><p>5.      Option to set frame rate</p><p>6.      Default object- cube</p><p>In 3D animation, we try to mimic the real world. Just like a movie is shot using a camera and light sources, even 3D softwares have these in digital form. The timeline shows us the number of frames that we’ll be using in our animation. We can change it as per our needs and also go to the frame on which we want to work. Render option gives us the option to render a single frame or the whole animation, as per our needs. If you do not know what rendering is, don’t worry. I’ll get to it soon. We can also set the frame rate for our animation. The default is set at 24 frames per second(fps).  At the start, a default cube is given, which can be deleted, and we can add or create our own objects.</p><p><b>Rendering: </b>This is the process of generating an image from a 3D model or a scene through a computer software. The software used to render a scene is called Render engine. They use different algorithms to render a scene. Some algorithms are rasterization, ray casting and ray tracing. Ray tracing is a bit efficient and better algorithm than the other two. Here the software simulates emission of rays from the camera onto the scene and calculates the bouncing of light from surfaces until it reaches the light source or bounces for a specific no of times. This saves a lot of work because now the number of light rays to be calculated is phenomenally lesser than that if they would have been emitted from the lamp.</p><p><b>Post processing</b>: This is the process of quality improvement image processing. It allows us to add some effects to the images to improve their quality and maybe make it look aesthetically better.</p><p><b>Compositing: </b>This is the process of combing images from different sources into one image to create the illusion as if they are part of the same scene. Whenever live-action shooting is done for compositing it is called chroma key, blue screen or green screen animation. </p><p>I’ll talk about Camera tracking in my next post! Stay tuned!</p>
