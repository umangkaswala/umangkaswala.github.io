		<p>Hey there! I'm Umagn. I'm a Software Engineer at ifm. I graduated from University of Applied Sciences Ravensburg-Weingarten in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology. I like to read about Computer Graphics, programming and anything related to Software used in Films! I've been a GSoC candidate twice, once with <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/4838049433780224/">TensorFlow</a> in 2019 and with the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5493236614823936">Academy Software Foundation (OpenTimelineIO)</a> in 2020. I've also been a Mentor with TensorFlow in <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organization/6265089057882112/">Google Code-In 2019</a>. I've been to a few hackathons and secured top positions in a few.</p>

    <p>When I'm not working you'll find me watching movies/tv-series, working on some 3D art on Blender or reading.</p>
